                 Our Motto: "The Trend Begins Here!"
                <br>
                <br>
                 The timing is right for starting this new venture. Patiently searching for six months for the perfect location, one was finally found. The demand from the owner's clients, as well as the ambitions of the owner to one day start her own salon, and the procurement of highly professional and qualified beauticians to support the salon, has made this business one of great potential.
                <br>
                <br>
                 miss jennylicious, co-owner with Roller Comb, Jr., her husband, has worked in a prestigious, upscale salon in MyTown, Texas for the past two years. Curley has created a large client following through hard work and dedication. Curley, and her talented team of beauticians, has what it takes to make this venture an extremely successful one. We expect our growing reputation to lead to new clients and beauticians to support our anticipated growth.
               <br>
               <br>
                 To achieve our objectives, Trend Setters is seeking additional loan financing. This loan will be paid from the cash flow from the business, and will be collateralized by the assets of the company, and backed by the character, experience, and personal guarantees of the owners.
